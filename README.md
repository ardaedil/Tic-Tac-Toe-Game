#Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe (also known as Noughts and Crosses) created using the Python tkinter library. It allows two players to take turns and play against each other, with a basic AI component for single-player mode.

##Project Description (What This Application Does)
This application provides a graphical user interface for playing the game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The game currently supports one mode:

Single-Player Mode: In this mode, you can play against a computer. The computer makes random moves. The game will announce if you win or lose against the computer or if the game ends in a tie.

##Technologies Used
The project uses the following technologies:

Python: The main programming language used for developing the game logic and UI.
Tkinter: A Python library for creating graphical user interfaces. It is used to build the game's graphical interface.
Randomization: The game incorporates randomization to simulate the computer opponent's moves in single-player mode.

##Future Features
While this implementation provides basic functionality for a Tic-Tac-Toe game, there are several potential features and improvements that could be added in the future:

Two-Player Mode: By using Artificial Intelligence, two computers will be able to take turns by clicking on the grid to place their respective X and O symbols. The game announces the winner or declares a tie when appropriate.
Game Restrictions: Having a set of rules to make the Tic-Tac-Toe Game harder.
Improved AI: Creating a more intelligent AI that employs strategies to win or block the opponent.

##How to Play
Run the program.

In Single-Player Mode, you play against the computer.
